Description: In William Hill we decided to build the “new stack” for customer data-driven business, it has been an aggressive adoption of complimentary distributed frameworks that play very nicely with the key Reactive tenets of Spark together with Scala, Akka and Cassandra, and make the company’s data platform Reactive all the way through. Each technology assumes a different role that compliments the others. This is a great opportunity to see a real use case of adoption of cutting edge technologies in one of the most dynamic and revolutionary industry.
